<p>I’m a software developer from Manchester, 
who currently resides in Oxford. 
I work on both front-end and back-end technologies, designing and developing web platforms and APIs.
When I’m not doing that, I start side projects that I never get round to finishing (one day!), and I think a lot about Techno music……
